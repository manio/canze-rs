## How it works
![Hardware overview](images/canze-rs.webp)

## Description
This small linux tool is intended to connect to Renault Zoe's CAN bus and save some basic parameters to InfluxDB.<br>
Name of the project is inspired by (and a tribute to) a great [CanZE](https://canze.fisch.lu/) project.<br>

#### This tools is saving the following four parameters to Influx:
- SOC (state of charge)
- Active power from the grid (when charging from AC)
- SOH (battery's state of health)
- Total vehicle distance (odometer)

It is intended to running constantly (as a daemon) sensing when the car's OBD dongle is in range.
When the car is not in sleep mode (eg. when it is charging), then it is saving the parameters.

## Usage
```
canze-rs 0.1.0
